#### Implementation and Testing Unit Level 8

##### Testing tasks (Rachael Ellen)

In this folder I have saved the comments on the incorrect code in 'testing_task_1_RE_comments.md'

In 'testing_task_2.rb' I have adjusted the incorrect code enough so that it fails the Ruby minitest tests: otherwise, terminal was returning errors and as I understood, the points of the exercise was to show the tests failing.

In 'testing_task_2_working.rb' I have saved the correct code for class CardGame, which take into account my comments from 'testing_task_1_RE_comments'.

The test file is saved as 'spec.rb'

Screenshots showing the results of 'testing_task_2_working.rb' passing all tests are saved in the 'Screenshots of tests' folder, as are screenshots of the tests failing when running 'testing_task_2.rb'
